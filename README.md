A quick Summary
Cout << "Hello World" << endl;
My name is Terrence Lewis, and I'm currently a student pursuing my Systems and Programming Major.
As of right now, I've experienced C++ (Visual Studio), Xcode, Java(Eclipse), web design(Visual Studio) and experienced database(SQL) 
Soon I'll be taking courses based off making video games and Python Programming Language.
My biggest goals are to learn as many programming languages as possible, and use that knowledge to make our technology more accessible for everyone.
Over the course of Covid-19, I noticed that majority of our society had to resort to more technical advancements to help stop the spread of the virus
Unfortunately a good portion of people didn't get the chance to learn, or we didn't make things easier for people who rarely relied on tech (Phones, Computers, Apps, etc)
Therefore some people were more of less left to learn themselves or possibly forced to expose themselves to the virus.
I want to expand my knowledge of many programming languages, so that I can add or create accessibility options, so that no one's left behind.
This also applies with-in the medical field, if I can help make our technology more open to people even with disabilities, that would make me a happy programmer.
I still have a lot to learn, there's still many programming languages to understand and even more code per language.
I want to be able to cover a majority of the programming languages companies use, so that maybe I can help improve them, and make it easier for everyone to use.
I look forward to seeing how far I can go.
